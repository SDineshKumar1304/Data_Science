# Twitter US Airline Sentiment Analysis

## Introduction

This data science project focuses on sentiment analysis using the Twitter US Airline Sentiment dataset. The goal is to analyze tweets about various US airlines and classify them into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments. The insights gained from this analysis can be valuable for airlines to understand customer feedback and sentiment trends.

## Project Overview

In this project, we leverage natural language processing (NLP) techniques to analyze tweets collected from Twitter. The dataset includes information about the airline, tweet content, and the sentiment expressed by the user.

## Dataset

The Twitter US Airline Sentiment dataset is obtained from (https://www.kaggle.com/crowdflower/twitter-airline-sentiment). It comprises tweets directed at six major US airlines. The data has been preprocessed to handle text cleaning, tokenization, and label encoding for sentiment categories.

## Methods

We use a combination of text vectorization techniques and machine learning models to perform sentiment analysis. The scikit-learn library is employed for text processing and model development.

## Results

The sentiment analysis results reveal patterns in customer sentiment towards different airlines. Visualization techniques such as word clouds and bar charts provide insights into the most common words associated with positive and negative sentiments.

# Telco Customer Churn Analysis

## Introduction

This data science project focuses on analyzing customer churn in a Telco company. The primary objective is to understand the factors that contribute to customer churn and to develop insights for retaining customers.

## Project Overview

In this project, we utilize machine learning and statistical analysis to explore the Telco Customer Churn dataset. The dataset includes information about customers, their usage patterns, and whether they churned or not.

## Data

The Telco Customer Churn dataset is obtained from [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn]. It contains features such as customer demographics, services subscribed, contract details, and churn status. Data preprocessing steps involve handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and balancing the target variable.

## Methods

We employ machine learning models such as RandomForestClassifier predicting customer churn. Feature importance analysis is performed to understand the key factors influencing customer decisions.

## Results

The analysis reveals patterns in customer churn, highlighting factors that significantly impact customer retention. Visualizations, including pie charts and bar graphs, provide a clear representation of churn distribution and influential features.

## Usage

To reproduce this project:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone [https://github.com/SDineshKumar1304/DataScience_Projects.git]`
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook: `jupyter notebook telco_churn_analysis.ipynb`

Note: The dataset is not included in the repository due to its size. You can download it from [Data Source(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn)].

# Project 3
# Employee Turnover Prediction

## Introduction

This data science project focuses on predicting employee turnover using the IBM HR Analytics Attrition dataset. The goal is to understand the factors contributing to employee attrition and develop a predictive model to identify individuals at risk of leaving the organization.

## Project Overview

In this project, we employ machine learning techniques to analyze the HR dataset. The dataset includes information about employee demographics, job satisfaction, work environment, and whether an employee left the company.

## Data

The IBM HR Analytics Attrition dataset is obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pavansubhasht/ibm-hr-analytics-attrition-dataset). It contains features such as age, education, job role, and job satisfaction. Data preprocessing includes handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and exploring class distribution.

## Methods

Machine learning models such as  random forest are used for predicting employee turnover. Feature importance analysis is performed to identify the key factors influencing employee attrition.

## Results

The analysis provides insights into the factors contributing to employee turnover. Visualizations, including bar charts and correlation matrices, offer a comprehensive view of the dataset and the relationships between features.

## Usage

To reproduce this project:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone [repository_url]`
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook: `jupyter notebook employee_turnover_prediction.ipynb`
